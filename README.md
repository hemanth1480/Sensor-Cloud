# Sensor-Cloud

Sensor cloud is a attempt to create a tool to store, visualise and process data recieved from a sensor. It is an IOT based website, data can be uploaded through a simple "http" request using arduino, raspberry pi or other boards.
The data which is uploaded can be processed using AI Alogorithms such as NeuralProphet. I am Currently working on adding these elements to the site.

The site is under development! thanks
